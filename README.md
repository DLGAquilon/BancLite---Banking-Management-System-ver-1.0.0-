// Login and Registration - uses a file database to imitate storing of client credentials, passwords, and initial balances. To enter the main interface, you must register an account first before logging in to the program. The program then checks if the password inputted and the pw on the database is matching.

// Deposits - user must input any amount of imaginary cash then the user must input his/her password to validate and do the deposit process. The program adds the inputted money on the user's account. A transaction history file is also used, noting the transaction made using the system time.

// Withdrawals - user inputs any amount from their balance. An error will show if ever the user tries to withdraw more than they have in their balance. An OTP is needed so that withdraw process will perform. Program subtracts the inputted amount to the balance.

// Bank Statement - the program prints all the info of the database. User can edit their info from name to password, but not the balance. The user could also delete their own account, unabling to access it once again. The transaction history is also loaded into a table for data transparency between the system and the user.
